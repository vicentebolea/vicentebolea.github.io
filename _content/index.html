	<h2>What I do</h2>
	<p>I do many interesting things, but, from a technical point of view
	it might not be that much profitable. Jokes apart, I have a strong expertise
	from inside Academia and Industry in the areas of Software Engineering, 
	specifically Big Data Systems and UNIX systems. Things I can do for you are: </p>
	<br/>

	<ul class='keyPoints'>
		<li>Assess on ideas in that domain</li>
		<li>Develop solutions for complex problems</li>
		<li>Contribute with knowledgeable ideas</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>

	<p>Very importantly, I do all these things for free, but only if the software 
	is OSS and I am interested on it. If we are talking about a commercial or boring 
	product, my suffering shall be compensate.</p>
